1.07  Made the tests more tollerant to cope with modern versions
      of libxml2.

      html no longer quotes '"', so altered tests to cope with
      both versions.

      Bah, testing xml with string comparison is hard!

1.06  stoped Makefile.PL creating a makefile that runs Build.PL
      by mistake

      Actually fixed the bug from 1.02.

1.05  Added Build.PL and META.yml

      Added how to use Build.PL to README

      Updated documentation to reflect Christian Glahn's work
      on XML::LibXML

      Updated some of the code examples to use the html filter
      module where they should

1.04  Element tag name -> VIEW block mapping changed to use only
      A-Za-z0-9.  This is bad, but will have to do.  Weird non
      ASCII chars should be changed to '_'

1.03  Debug code commented out

1.02  Patches from Tatsuhiko Miyagawa to account for a stray
      use warnings, and removal of {} in Makefile.PL that caused
      it to always claim not to have a modern Scalar::Util.

      CHANGES added.

1.01  Inital Release
